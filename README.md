# Developing and Comparing Machine Learning Approaches for Predicting Insurance Penetration Rates
This repository contains the data and code related to our research paper titled "Developing and Comparing Machine Learning Approaches for Predicting Insurance Penetration Rates Based on Each Country."

## Overview
In this study, we explore various machine learning models to predict insurance penetration rates across different countries. Our goal is to develop models that accurately forecast both life and non-life insurance penetration rates based on economic, financial, and legal indicators. We also compare the performance of these models to identify the most effective approach.

## Data
The dataset used in this study includes several key indicators from multiple countries over the years. The dataset consists of the following columns:

## Country: The name of the country.
Year: The year of the recorded data.
lifeInsurancePenetrationRate: The percentage of life insurance penetration in the respective country.
Non_LifeInsurancePenetrationRate: The percentage of non-life insurance penetration.
TotalInsurancePenetrationRate: The total percentage of insurance penetration (life + non-life).
InflationRateToconsumerIndex: The inflation rate based on the consumer price index.
DomesticCreditToPrivateSector: The percentage of domestic credit provided to the private sector.
RuleOfLaw_Estimate: An estimate of the rule of law within the country.
FinancialDevelopmentIndex: An index measuring the financial development within the country.
EconomicGrowthPercent: The percentage of economic growth.
TradePercent: The percentage of trade relative to the countryâ€™s GDP.
FDI: The foreign direct investment as a percentage of GDP.
